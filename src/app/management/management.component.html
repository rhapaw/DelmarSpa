      <p>
        Delmar Property Management has been involved in the Property Management,
        Development, and Construction Industry in California since 1991. The
        company has engineered, constructed, and managed various types of
        projects. Our experience as owners has given us the disciplines
        necessary to be responsible, timely, accurate Asset Managers and
        Property Managers for Institutions and Individual Investors. Coupled
        with a team of well qualified professionals, Delmar Property
        Management's best asset is its conservative approach, tenant retention
        program and analysis of the marketplace backed by long-term planning,
        years of experience and our financial strength.

        Delmar Property Management is supported by a team of Real Estate and
        Financial Professionals who acquired their skills through hands on
        experience and practice. Delmar uses the latest in computer hardware and
        software technology to assist the management; decision making and

        enhanced by Spectra Professional property management software,

      </p>

      <h3>Construction Management</h3>
      <p>
        Delmar offers our clients a most effective management team for tenant
        improvements. Owning and constructing our own projects gives us
        experience that we pass on to our clients. Delmar has been involved in
        extensive remodeling of large suites that were constructed in phases to
        allow tenants to remain in their suites. Our tenants were able to
        continue with business as usual due to the efficient scheduling of
        construction around their needs. The volume of tenant improvements and
        remodels that Delmar is involved in allows us to offer our tenants
        competitive costs from contractors and suppliers. The Delmar client is
        offered expertise on design, space planning, and construction.
      </p>
